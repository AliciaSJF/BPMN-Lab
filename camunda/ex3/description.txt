Credit Scoring
Background
A credit protection agency (in Germany called „Schufa“) allows customers to 
query a credit rating for persons via a technical interface. 
Exercise: Please model the following process
The sales clerks in a bank can use their software frontend to receive the creditscoring for a certain customer. This starts a process in the banking system which 
communicates with the agency in the background.
This process sends a scoring request to the agency right after the beginning. 
Then, the Agency does a first quick scoring (level 1). This will often lead to an 
immediate result which is then returned directly to the banking system within 
seconds. The banking process presents the result to the clerk sitting at the 
frontend.
Sometimes the scoring cannot be determined immediately and takes longer. In 
this case the agency informs the banking process of the delay and then starts the 
level 2 scoring (which can take up to a couple of minutes). After the scoring 
result is determined, the information is sent back to the banking process. The 
banking process displays a message to the clerk when he receives information 
about the delay to check again later. As soon as the result arrives, it can be seen 
at the frontend.
Please use 3 pools for your model:
- Banking Frontend  collapsed pool (do not model details)
- Scoring (Bank)  expanded pool (model all details)
- Scoring (Credit protection agency)  expanded pool (model all details)
